## 🔍 Overview
This project documents my completion and analysis of IBM's lab guide for QRadar SIEM (Course Code: LSL0232X). The hands-on simulation covers threat detection, investigation, reporting, and SIEM customization using QRadar 7.4.

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Navigating QRadar Console
- Dashboard & Pulse Widget Customization
- AQL Query Writing for Event & Flow Analysis
- Investigating Remote Access Offenses
- Creating RDP Reports & Search Templates
- Network Hierarchy Configuration
- Working with Rule Wizard & Analyst App

## 🧪 Lab Structure
1. Log in and explore dashboards
2. Visualize Flow Bias with QFlow
3. Create Pulse dashboards with AQL
4. Investigate RDP-based attack offense
5. Build and run offense response rules
6. Save & generate reports based on RDP activity
7. Mark IPs as local in network hierarchy
8. Close and document the offense

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- IBM QRadar SIEM v7.4 (Lab Simulated)
- QFlow for network traffic analysis
- Ariel Query Language (AQL)
- Pulse Dashboard App
- Analyst App

## 📎 Report Snapshot
> Created a real-time monitoring report template for RDP access using saved searches and flow-based data, then exported to PDF using QRadar reporting engine.
